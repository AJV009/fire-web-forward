          <strong>Marc J. Rochkind</strong> invented the Source Code Control
          System while working at Bell Labs, as well as wrote Advanced UNIX
          Programming, and founded XVT Software, Inc.

          Computers have grown to become very friendly machines. If you mess up
          and accidentally delete a couple of paragraphs from an important
          document, there’s no reason to panic — you just hit undo. But it
          hasn’t always been like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Way back in the early days of the digital revolution, most people
          hadn’t even heard of computers — but the ones who did had a much
          harder time using them. Software developers at the time didn’t have
          access to a version control system, and instead worked with a single
          person who owned the master version of a project. This person would
          only share the specific part of the code someone needed to work on, a
          developer would return the finished code and finally everything was
          checked for standards before the old version was fully replaced by the
          new version.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, it was quite a tedious process. Unless someone actively
          made recurring copies, there wasn’t easy access to previous versions.
          Until one day in 1972, when developer Marc Rochkind couldn’t deal with
          it anymore. He ended up creating Source Code Control System (SCCS),
          the very first version control system. It was pretty limited in
          functionality — only one person could be working on a file at a time
          and concurrent development was managed with locks. However, it also
          solved a lot of problems — multiple versions didn’t need to take up
          large amounts of disk space anymore, and merging optimizations became
          a lot easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second generation of VCS consisted of tools like CVS and came with
          improvements across the board. In general, they gave users a lot more
          flexibility, but one thing remained — revisions needed to be merged
          before they could be committed. It was time to solve this problem and
          take version control into a new age.
